The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file, and you reference it with the HTML 'script' tag (notice that the 'script' tag should be outside the 'body' section at the bottom):

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-3.0.0.min.js"></script>
```

After including jQuery you need to include placeholder.js in your web page by downloading this project or clone is project
Include place-holder.js after the jquery library
